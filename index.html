          <span class="indent">An objective of this course was a project of an app that allows requesting collections of
            old house appliances for
            recycling. Front end is a React app, back end is in C#, using MySQL database hosted on AWS cloud. The course
            was simulation of work in a standard development team. Most current development workflow and procedures
            (agile, TDD and so on) were taught and implemented.

        <ul>
          <li>setting up GitHub organisation and repos for the project</li>
          <li>initialising React app and setting up navigation, page layout and style</li>
          <li>creating content of public site</li>
          <li>making calls to the back end api</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In my case it wasn't so much about returning to tech as about advancing in tech. As a self-taught web
          developer
          most of my knowlege came from what I learned while working. I found it very hard to learn new things on my
          own, in isolation. The course allowed me to advance my technical ability and upgrade my JavaScript skills and
          gain good foundations in React. I have also enjoyed exposure to and interaction with C# and AWS cloud
          throughout my project.

        <p>
          Please note that I did only coding, not graphic design. Except of my last job, all sites have been rebuilt by
          someone else since I worked on them, I put them on the list only to show what type of websites I have
          experience with. Also many of them were partially built by my team mates.</p>
