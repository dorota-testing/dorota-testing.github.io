        <h2>Return to Tech</h2>
        <p>
          In my case it isn't so much about returning to tech as about advancing in tech. As a self-taught web developer
          most of my knowlege came from what I learned while working. I worked as junior developer and got stuck with
          that position and skillset. I find it very hard to get to a higher level on my own, in isolation. I hope
          working with team of other coders and being led by experienced teachers will help me with this.
