          <br /><em>responsibilities:</em>
          <span class="indent">
            I worked on variety of websites using custom PHP, HTML and styling in CSS (according to visuals provided by a graphic designer). I implemented jQuery plug-ins and developed custom jQuery scripts.
          </span>
          <em>achievements:</em>
        <ul>
          <li>I learned PHP (when I started working, I didn’t know any)</li>

          <li><strong>Processes:</strong> Agile, Pair Programming, Git, GitHub, editing images (Gimp/Photoshop), integration with 3rd party syststems (inventory, bulk mail)</li>

        <h2>Return to Tech</h2>
        <p>
          In my case it isn't so much about returning to tech as about advancing in tech. As a self-taught web developer
          most of my knowlege came from what I learned while working. I worked as junior developer and got stuck with
          that position and skillset. I find it very hard to get to a higher level on my own, in isolation. I hope
          working with team of other coders and being led by experienced teachers will help me with this.
